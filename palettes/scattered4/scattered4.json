    "description": "I tried to make a 4-color palette that strayed from the common monoramp format as much as possible, to try to have as much functionality as say, DB8, which may be a bit overly ambitious for 4 colors. \u00a0Still, I tried to make the best use of them by scattering them out across the color space while also keeping them as balanced as I could. \u00a0Hopefully people find this palette useful for overcoming the 4-color limitations!",
