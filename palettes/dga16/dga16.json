    "description": "Greatly inspired by the CGA/EGA era in the DOS gaming days fresh outta both the entire 1980s and early 1990s, this very newest palette by me takes all 16 of the main base colors of the original CGA/EGA and quite dials back the overly blatant high contrast to just the right balance \u2014 as well as vastly improving the hue shifting of them \u2014 making them all rather more sleeker, more modernized, and much, much better overall while being A LOT easier on the eyes also, quite importantly.\u00a0 This promises to be such a wonderfully handsome new replacement in bringing back those amazing glory days of DOS gaming and ANSI graphics both in such splendid style indeed!!",
