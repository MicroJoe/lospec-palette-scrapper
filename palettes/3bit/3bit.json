    "description": "The\u00a03-Bit RGB\u00a0palette, but with the colours adjusted to be perceptually linear at a gamma of 2.4 (A gamma of 2.2 works better with the lights on, and a gamma of 2.4 with the lights off... like night mode). This lends it a shiny, chrome-like effect similar to art you'd see on the Atari ST/Amiga, makes the colours less fluorescent, allows for good dark/background/low-contrast details (that's always been a pain on EGA games, as you can see), and makes for better colour ramping/gradient usage - especially in modern \"limited truecolour\" art instead of art that uses attribute blocks/tiles, ASCII, or sprites. If you like this and want to see more hardware palettes converted to look like this, write me a comment.",
